# Fossify Gallery

This repository is a fork of [Gallery](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery), aiming to extend the boundaries of image search through `Captions` generated by OCR models and large language models. The completed and planned tasks are as follows:

- [x] Created the `Captions` table and provided comprehensive queries for file names and `Caption` content in the image view.
- [x] Utilized Google ML Kit‚Äôs text recognition module to generate offline `Captions` for images in the gallery based on an offline OCR model. This implementation completed the feature request in [#295](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/294).
- [x] Implemented left-right swipe functionality in search results and fixed [#347](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/347).
- [x] Implemented import and export functionality for the `Captions` table.
- [ ] Implement online or local network `Caption` generation via OpenAI‚Äôs API specification. This will allow the use of multimodal large language models to generate semantically rich `Captions` for images, or leverage more powerful OCR models on PC or server-side to produce more accurate text `Captions`. This feature is currently on hold due to OpenAI's lack of a Kotlin-based client library [#70](https://github.com/openai/openai-java/issues/70). If implemented later, it may partially address [#19](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Gallery/issues/19), although I believe running multimodal large language models offline on mobile devices remains challenging.
- [ ] Optimize search performance for the `content` field in the `Captions` table using [FTS5](https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html) technology.
- [ ] Implement more advanced query logic, such as support for logical operators like `AND` and `OR`.
